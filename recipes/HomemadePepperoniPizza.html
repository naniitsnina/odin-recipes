    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Contadina(R) Quick Pizza Sauce:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>½ (12 ounce) can CONTADINA® Tomato Paste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano, crushed</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried basil, crushed</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon sugar</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon black pepper </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Easy Pizza Crust:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3¼ cups all-purpose flour, or more as needed</li>
        <li>2 (.25 ounce) envelopes FLEISCHMANN'S® Pizza Crust Yeast or RapidRise® Yeast</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
        <li>1½ teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1⅓ cups very warm water (120 degrees F to 130 degrees F)</li>
        <li>⅓ cup oil </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Toppings:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (6 ounce) package HORMEL® Pepperoni</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese, or more to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>For sauce: Combine all sauce ingredients with 1/2 cup water in a medium bowl; set aside for flavors to
            develop while making crust. Freeze remaining paste .
        </li>
        <li>For crusts: Combine 2 cups of flour with the dry yeast, sugar and salt. Add the water and oil and mix until
            well blended (about 1 minute). Gradually add enough remaining flour slowly, until a soft, sticky dough ball
            is formed.
        </li>
        <li>Knead for about 4 minutes, on a floured surface, until dough is smooth and elastic. Add more flour, if
            needed. (If using RapidRise® Yeast, let dough rest, covered, for 10 minutes.)
        </li>
        <li>Divide dough in half. Pat each half (with floured hands) into a 12-inch greased pizza pan OR roll dough to
            fit pans.
        </li>
        <li>For pizzas: Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Top crusts with sauce, pepperoni and cheese.
        </li>
        <li>Bake for 18 to 20 minutes until crusts are browned and cheese is bubbly. For best results, rotate pizza pans
            between top and bottom oven racks halfway through baking.
        </li>
    </ol>
